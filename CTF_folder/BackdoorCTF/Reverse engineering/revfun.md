Using `ida64` it shows us that it gets the length of a string and stores it and the other variable stores the flag. It does a for loop comparing each characters of the flag with `dlr0w_s1h7_s1_yz4rC` which gets reversed to `Cr4zy_1s_7h1s_w0rld`. If a character is not equal to one of the chars in the reverse string it displays "Incorrect Password!" 
```python 
#!/usr/bin/python3
reversed_flag_string = len("dlr0w_s1h7_s1_yz4rC") 
compare = "Cr4zy_1s_7h1s_w0rld" 
for i in range(0, reversed_flag_string):     
if compare[i] != "dlr0w_s1h7_s1_yz4rC"[reversed_flag_string - i - 1]:         
	exit(-1)     
else:         
	print("Correct flag!")         
	print("Flag:", reversed_flag_string[::-1])
	break 
``` 
``` 
Flag: Cr4zy_1s_7h1s_w0rld 
```
